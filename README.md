### What I learned

I used this project as part of the "Advanced CSS techniques" learning path on the Frontend Mentor platform to practice the CUBE CSS methodology created by Andy Bell.
While working on this project, my major struggles were related to understanding the principles of this methodology and efficiently applying them.
I'm looking forward to expanding my knowledge and learning how to adapt it to larger projects.
